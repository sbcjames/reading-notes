# Operators and Loops Reading

## Read :

- Duckett: JavaScript & jQuery:
- Comparison and logical operators: 150-151, 156, and 157 for and while loops: 170 - 173, and 176

### Notes:

- operations are function same as math with some exclusions works same as <, <, >=, and <=
    - == is same
    - != is not equal to
    - === is strict equal to
    - !=== is strict not equal to

- Comparison operators usually return single values of *true* or *false*
- && is Logical And ie tests more than one condition
- || is Logical Or ie operator tests at least one condition
- ! is Logical Not ie takes a single Boolean value and inverts it
- short circuit evaluation ie logical expressions are evaluated left to right

- Loops check a condition. It will run a block of code if true and will receck and will continue until returns false
- Three main types of loops:
    - For - running a loop specific number of times
    - While - running the loop as long as the condition is true
    - Do While - Will always run the code, even if false atleast one but other than that is very simar to While
- For loop uses a counter, you can set how many times it runs
- For will count using a '+'
