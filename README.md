# James Swift

Hello! Thank you for coming to my page. I am a Seattle native, but spent almost 10 years in sunny southern California. So winters are hard for me here, I own so many jackets and use an umbrella - not a Seattle trait. I have never coded but very excited to learn as much as possible and have a great time doing it.
