## EJS

- EJS is a simple templating language that lets you generate HTML markup and plain JaveScript
- it is stated to be simple and easy to use
- use <% %> to inject something from your index.ejs file
- use <%= %> to evaluate something you are inserting
- you can look over information and have it evaluated before inserting it in
- it's easy to debug EJS errors: your errors are plain JavaScript exceptions, with template line-numbers included
- both server JS and browser support
- just another install: npm install ejs
