## Node.js

- Node.js is a program we use to execute JavaScript on our computers it is a JavaScript runtime
- Node comes bundled with a package manager called npm. npm is the world’s largest software registry. There are over 1,000,000 packages of JavaScript code available to download
- you install (via npm) and run (via Node) various build tools — designed to automate the process of developing a JavaScript app
- Node.js lets us run JavaScript on the srver

## What is Node.js suited for

- building applications that require some form of real-time interaction or collaboration
- building APIs where you’re handling lots of requests that are I/O driven (ie needing to perform operations on a database) or for sites involving data streaming, as Node makes it possible to process files while still being uploaded.

## Advantages of Node.js

- scalability and speed
- you can do everything in the same language. ie- you can easily share code between client and server
- also one of Node’s big pluses is that it uses JSON
- with a background in JS, transitioning to Node development is potentially easier than to other server-side languages.\
