# Read Duckett: JavaScript & jQuery, Pages 43 - 69

- JS build on prior languages of HTML and CSS
- Changes how the page reacts and behaves
- Not everyone browses with JS, so need to make sure works for everyone
- Keep it seperate, so if it doesnt work page can still load
- JS runs where it is placed
- statements are instuctions and each one starts on a new line and end with ;
- comments tell what is happening in code or code block
- use */ comments */ for multi line and // for single line comments
- Variables are little info that is needed to perform the action
- JS distinguishes between numbers, strings, and true or false values aka boolean data but there will be more learned later
