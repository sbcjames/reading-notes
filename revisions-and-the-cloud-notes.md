# Reading day two

* Version control is like a bread crumb trail of what has changed in coding and when it was changed. can be local or on a master list for all that have changed it called a centralized version control.
* To move excisting Git files to terminal us command git clone then the link
* head is used to show what was recently changed, like a title
* to add commit message us "insert info"
* after making changes us the ACP = add, commit and push
* git add + git commit + git push orgin master
* git stash will allow you to save changes but not show them // git stash apply will apply them later +ie if need to take a break but not wanting to publish changes
