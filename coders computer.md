## reading from the Coders Computer

-all computers come with a text editor
-make sure to have some enhancemenets for the editor (i.e. code completion, syntax highlighter, and code completion)
-make sure to have correct file extention when saving.
-I do wonder since there are so many free if companies require you to use their editor or each coder can choose when actually working.

-IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is really a suite of different software all coming together. An IDE is a text editor, a file manager, a compiler, and a debugger all in one software package.
