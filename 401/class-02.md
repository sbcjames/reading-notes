# Testing and Modules

1. unit tests are some pieces of code to exercise the input, the output and the behavior of your code. (can be written anytime)
1. always seperate your tests from production
1. remember the AAA method

  - Arrange: you need to organize the data needed to execute that piece of code (input)
  - Act: here you will execute the code being tested (exercise teh behaviour)
  - Assert: after executing the code, you will check if the result (output) is the same as you were expecting

### The Cycle

1. cycle is mad by three steps:
- Write a unit test and make it fail
- Write the feature and make the test pass!
- Refactor the code - the first version doesn't need to be the beautiful one (don't be shy)

1. make sure you are taking baby steps

## Recursion

1. The process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly is called recursion and the corresponding function is called as recursive function.
