# Structure web pages with HTML

## Chapter 18

make sure to have a target audience for your website ie write to them
Know they wâ€™s of your site (why, what, when, who, and how often)
Create wire frame to get the ideal layout of the site
Prioritize the information so your main ideas/info standout against secondary info
Most website visitors just skim, use color, size and style to draw attention to important things
High contract will be seen first = images first

## Chapter 1 - skim

-more tools - developer tools to see html code for websites (chrome) or view then view source (safari)

## Chapter 17

header and footer is just like a word doc - stays at top or bottom
Nav is for major website navigation blocks
Section to work indifferent areas of your page, help visually get around, may have own header
Html5 is cleaning writing but may need support or extra instructions how to work in older browsers
Lots of examples of codes starting pg 445

## Chapter 8

I wish we all could just use html 5, sounds easier for the coder
class attributes will only change by using css
Block elements always start a new line
Inline elements can be on the same line as neighboring code
Iframe to have a window cut into your own page ie maps
Escape characters make special characters on webpage
