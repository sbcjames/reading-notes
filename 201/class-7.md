# Reading Day 7

### Domain Modeling

<ul>
  <li>modeling single entitiy that will have many instances =, build self-containing objects with the same attributes and behaviors</li>
  <li>model with small methods and focus on one job</li>
  <li>store the newly created object in a variable so can be called outside the fucntion</li>
  <li>use this. to access information inside </li>
</ul>

### HTML Chapter 6: “Tables” (pp.126-145)
<ul>
  <li>tables show info in a grid format. content is written row by row in HTML</li>
  <li><table> are used to add the tabale to webpage (will need closing tag)</li>
  <li><tr> is the tabel row (will need closing tag)</li>
  <li><td> is the table data (will need closing tag)</li>
  <li><th> is the table header (will need closing tag)</li>
  <li>you can make cells of a table span more than one row or column using the rowspan and colspan attributes</li>
</ul>

### JS Chapter 3: “Functions, Methods, and Objects” (pp.106-144)

<ul>
  <li>contrstructor functions used to create multiple opjects within the smae page by bilding a template for the objects</li>
  <li>they are condensed and comaparised to literal notation</li>
  <li>they are made up of instances and prototypes</li>
  <li>contextual "this" is the keyword word used to identify a key within the object</li>
  <li>ordering matters since JS reads top to bottom, start with global variables, then objet contructor(instances and prototypes-functions/loops) then invoke the functions</li>
</ul>
