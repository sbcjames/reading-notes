# Reading Day 8

## More CSS Layout

### Read: HTML/CSS book, Ch. 15, “Layout” (again; repeat of Class 4 reading)

<ul>
  <li>CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box, will be either inline or block-level</li>
  <li>if box-level are inside each other the outer box is known as containing element or parent</li>
  <li>CSS uses positioning schemes - normal flow, relative positioning, absolute positioning, and even float too</li>
  <li>box offset will tell the browser where to positon a box from top or bottom/left or right</li>
  <li>"Fixed position" is a form of absolute positioning, do not move when the user scrolls</li>
  <li>Floating elements allow you to tak ethat element out of normal flow</li>
  <li>z-index will allow you to control which box appears on top</li>
  <li>different users will access your site with different size screens, needs to be plannd for when building to ensure they get all the info needed</li>
  <li>usually want to design a page around 960-1000px tall</li>
  <li>fixed layout pages generally are in px and do not change size as the user may change the sizing</li>
  <li>liquid layouts allow the change, but will use min and max to avoid missing info or distorting the content to much</li>
  <li>Grids help create professional and flexible designs</li>
  <li> CSS frameworks provide rules for common tasks</li>
  <li>You can use multiple CSS files on one page</li>
</ul>
