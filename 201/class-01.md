## HTML - Hypertext Markup Language

- HTML pages are electronic text documents
- Its conent, structure, and organization of the page
- its elements (opeing and closing tags) and attributes (additional info)

### Common Elements
- <body></body> within element in browser
- <html></html> doctype
- <footer></footer> bottom of page - like word
- <head></head> info about page, not on page but in address bar usually
- <h1></h1> headings, shows cascading info
- <p></p> paragraph

<!-- commons go here --> add a comment in HTML

- ID attribute - id - highlight a particular element from others
- class attribute - class - id several elements
- block elements - <h1>, <p>, <ul>, <li> elements that start a new line
- inline elements - <a>, <b>, <em>, <img> elements will continue same line
- <div> groups text and elements in a block
- <span> groups text and elements inline
- <iframe> inline frame to embed content on page
- <meta> element inside the had and contrains web page info

### HTML5

introduced new set of elements that allow dividing up the page

- helps to describe its structure
- I wish we all could just use html 5, sounds easier for the coder
- class attributes will only change by using css
- Block elements always start a new line
- Inline elements can be on the same line as neighboring code
- Iframe to have a window cut into your own page ie maps
- Escape characters make special characters on webpage

## JavaScript

- JS build on prior languages of HTML and CSS
- Changes how the page reacts and behaves
- Not everyone browses with JS, so need to make sure works for everyone
- Keep it seperate, so if it doesnt work page can still load
- JS runs where it is placed
- statements are instuctions and each one starts on a new line and end with ;
- comments tell what is happening in code or code block
- use */ comments */ for multi line and // for single line comments
- Variables are little info that is needed to perform the action
- JS distinguishes between numbers, strings, and true or false values aka boolean data but there will be more learned later
